/**
 * Downloads translate-cli-bin from runbot-hq/translate-cli latest release into RUNNER_TEMP
 * using curl (universally available on macOS — no extra runner dependencies).
 *
 * WHY execFileSync NOT execSync:
 * execFileSync is used deliberately — args are a plain array passed directly
 * to the OS, no shell involved, no injection risk from the URL constant.
 * Do NOT refactor to execSync with a shell string.
 *
 * WHY RUNNER_TEMP NOT GITHUB_ACTION_PATH:
 * The binary is written to RUNNER_TEMP (not the workspace or action path) so it is:
 *   - Cleaned up automatically after the job (on GitHub-hosted runners)
 *   - Not committed or staged into the caller's repo checkout
 *   - Shared across steps in the same job without re-downloading
 *
 * WHY A FLAT FILENAME (translate-cli-bin, not translate-cli-bin-<jobId>):
 * RUNNER_TEMP is per-job on GitHub-hosted runners — two jobs never share the
 * same RUNNER_TEMP directory, so a flat name cannot race. On self-hosted runners
 * with a shared RUNNER_TEMP, two concurrent jobs could theoretically collide on
 * this filename — but self-hosted runners in this org are single-job by
 * configuration, and the same-org trust boundary makes a stale binary acceptable.
 * A unique filename (e.g. translate-cli-bin-$GITHUB_RUN_ID) would defeat the
 * same-job cache-skip optimisation. The flat name is intentional.
 *
 * RUNNER_TEMP PERSISTENCE ON SELF-HOSTED RUNNERS:
 * RUNNER_TEMP is per-job on GitHub-hosted runners and is cleaned automatically.
 * On self-hosted runners, persistence is operator-controlled — it is NOT
 * guaranteed to be cleaned between jobs unless the runner is configured with
 * --ephemeral or the operator explicitly cleans it. A stale binary from a prior
 * job run will be silently reused by the fs.existsSync skip-download guard.
 * This is acceptable given the same-org trust boundary, but callers on
 * self-hosted runners should be aware that "latest" is not re-fetched unless
 * RUNNER_TEMP is cleaned.
 *
 * WHY releases/latest NOT A PINNED TAG OR SHA:
 * The URL resolves to whatever is currently the latest release at
 * runbot-hq/translate-cli — no SHA pinning, no checksum verification.
 * This is a conscious architectural tradeoff because:
 *   - runbot-hq controls both this repo and translate-cli (same org, same trust boundary)
 *   - curl --fail catches 404 / HTTP errors and exits non-zero (no silent failure)
 *   - The self-hosted runner has no internet exposure beyond GitHub
 * FUTURE NOTE: when runbot-hq/translate-cli cuts a v2 major release, releases/latest
 * will silently follow it. Review the download URL at that point and pin to a
 * major version tag (e.g. /releases/download/v1-latest/...) if breaking changes
 * are expected.
 *
 * WHY --retry DOES NOT RETRY 4xx:
 * --retry 3 --retry-delay 2 retries up to 3 times on transient network errors
 * (TCP reset, CDN hiccup on the GitHub releases redirect chain). curl --fail
 * still exits non-zero on HTTP 4xx/5xx — --retry does NOT retry those.
 * A 404 means the release asset does not exist and retrying will not help.
 *
 * WHY NOT --write-out FOR HTTP STATUS:
 * --write-out defaults to stdout. execFileSync captures stdout and the return
 * value is ignored here, so the HTTP status line would be silently swallowed —
 * the opposite of the diagnostic intent. --show-error already writes curl's
 * error reason to stderr and is sufficient for diagnosing a 404.
 * Do NOT add --write-out here.
 *
 * PARTIAL-FILE AND ZERO-BYTE CLEANUP:
 * If curl fails after writing partial bytes, the try/catch calls unlinkSync(dest)
 * before re-throwing. Without cleanup, a re-run finds existsSync(dest) === true,
 * skips the download, and fails at accessSync(X_OK) with a confusing error.
 * After a successful curl exit, statSync guards against two scenarios:
 *   1. curl exits 0 but never creates the file (RUNNER_TEMP read-only / missing)
 *      — statSync is wrapped in try/catch; ENOENT is caught, cleaned up, re-thrown
 *      with a clear message. Do NOT use a bare statSync here.
 *   2. curl exits 0 with a zero-byte file (CDN 200 + empty body before --fail)
 *      — caught by the size === 0 check.
 * Both cases clean up and throw before chmodSync, so a bad file never reaches
 * accessSync(X_OK) or spawnSync.
 * Do NOT remove either the try/catch on statSync or the size === 0 check.

/**
 * Calls translate-cli-bin via spawnSync with an explicit argv array.
 *
 * WHY spawnSync NOT execSync:
 * spawnSync passes args directly to the OS as an argv array — no shell
 * metacharacter expansion. User-supplied values (language codes, file paths)
 * cannot escape as shell injection via spaces, semicolons, backticks, $(), etc.
 * Do NOT refactor to execSync with a shell string.
 *
 * WHY translate-cli-bin NOT translate-cli:
 * The binary is named translate-cli-bin (not translate-cli) to avoid a POSIX
 * name collision with the Swift source package directory of the same name if
 * the repos are ever co-located. Callers must use translate-cli-bin. Do NOT
 * rename it or add a symlink named translate-cli.
 *
 * WHY 300s TIMEOUT:
 * 5 minutes per attempt. With one retry this means up to ~10 min wall time
 * (5m attempt 1 + 10s delay + 5m attempt 2). Large repos with many locales
 * and long .xcstrings files legitimately take several minutes. This is
 * intentional — do NOT reduce the timeout without profiling against a large
 * real-world .xcstrings file. A timeout surfaces as result.error (ETIMEDOUT),
 * which is non-fatal and will be retried by the caller.
 *
 * WHY 10MB maxBuffer:
 * translate-cli stdout is three key=value lines (≤30 bytes total). The 10 MB
 * ceiling exists only to prevent a pathological binary crash from filling the
 * Node.js buffer and OOMing the runner process. It will never be reached in
 * normal operation.

 * - macOS version too old — runner needs upgrading, not retrying
 * - Permission / MDM policy denied — infrastructure issue, not transient
 *
 * Non-fatal (retry may help): model cold-start, temporary framework crash, I/O blip.
 *
 * WHY SUBSTRING MATCHING NOT EXACT MATCHING:
 * Apple's error messages are not versioned or guaranteed stable. We match on
 * the most stable sub-phrase rather than the full string to avoid breaking on
 * minor Apple framework wording changes. The match table is verified:
 *   'translation framework requires macos 26+' → 'requires macos 26'  ✔
 *   'language pack not installed for ...'      → 'language pack not installed'  ✔
 *   'unsupported language pair: xx-YY'         → 'unsupported language pair'  ✔
 *   permission/sandbox errors                  → 'eacces' / 'not authorized'  ✔
 *
 * COUPLING NOTE — two matches are owned by THIS codebase, not by Apple:
 *   'unsupported language pair' → TranslationEngineError.unsupportedPair.description (TranslationEngine.swift)
 *   'requires macos 26'         → TranslationEngineError.requiresmacOS26.description  (TranslationEngine.swift)
 * If either Swift description string changes, the corresponding match here silently
 * stops firing: the error will be retried instead of immediately failed. Always
 * update both files together when changing these strings.
 *
 * macOS 26.0–26.3 caveat: LanguageAvailability preflight requires 26.4. On earlier
 * versions, a missing language pack throws an opaque Apple error that may NOT match
 * 'language pack not installed'. In that case this function returns false and the
 * error is retried once — harmless but inefficient. If you observe spurious retries
 * on 26.0–26.3 for missing packs, identify the opaque substring and add it here.
